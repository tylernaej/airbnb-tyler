Welcome to airbnb-tyler, my first fullstack project!

This project was intended to be a fullstack project with 1 3/4 crud that cloned the functionality of the popular airbnb website. The site has three main features; I will highlight them below: 

Authentication: 

Users can sign up and log into the site through modal forms. There are several prompts for the user to sign-up throughout the site, with the most easily accessible being in the upper right hand corner of the navigation bar (shown below). There is also a demo user login to test the sites functionality.

Spots:

Spots are the main feature of the website. Below are two areas where you can see the information displayed on the site. There is a splash page with the information for all spots, and the are more detailed individual pages for each spot. Users can select a spot from the splash page to be directed to the detailed view. Users can also manage their spots by updating or deleting information or entire spots.

Reveiews:

Only logged in users can read and write reviews. A user can read the reviews by clicking on the reviews link at the top of the detailed information spot page.

Once clicked, the user can read reviews and write a review for that spot. A user can only have 1 review per spot, and is able to delete that review and write another.

The goal of the project was to finish 1 3/4 crud; but there is plenty more functionality I look forward to adding!

Thanks for checking out my app!
